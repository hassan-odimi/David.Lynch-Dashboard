        ### A Personal Reflection

        *I am fascinated by cinema that defies convention and invites deeper reflection.*
        Only a few have done so like **David Lynch**. I have always admired his wonderfully strange personality, which reminds me of my grandfatherâ€™s eccentric spirit.
        His work â€” with its surreal imagery and layered narratives â€” has profoundly influenced modern art and cinema.

        This dashboard is my way of diving into the life of David Lynch through the books, art, and everyday objects that shaped his vision.
        I feel sadness at his passing, but his art and memory will live on through what he left behind.
